One District One Product (ODOP) initiative is aimed at fostering balanced regional development across all districts of Jammu and Kashmir. The initiative aims to select, brand, and promote at least One Product from each District (One District-One Product) of the state for enabling holistic socioeconomic growth across all regions.

ODOP seeks to empower local artisans, craftsmen, and entrepreneurs by identifying unique products synonymous with each district, thereby enhancing economic growth and creating sustainable livelihoods. From the intricate craftsmanship of Pashmina shawls to the aromatic saffron fields of Pampore, ODOP encapsulates the essence of Jammu and Kashmir's distinctiveness, fostering pride and prosperity in every district.Jammu and Kashmir, historically neglected due to Article 370, now sees ODOP as a beacon of change. With a focus on tourism and cultural promotion, ODOP aims to showcase the region's rich heritage to the nation, fostering economic growth and empowerment in underexplored districts.
